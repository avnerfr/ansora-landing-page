 * what makes a flat PNG read as a scene. The phone deliberately isn't here —
 * three objects in a half-width column left the desktop screenshot almost
 * entirely covered, and the phone gets a full-size panel of its own in the
 * Anywhere section anyway.
 *
 * The screenshot is public/desktop.png (copied from frontend/public). The
 * WhatsApp conversation is public/whatsapp.gif, an animated recording. Swap
 * either file to refresh the shot; nothing in this component needs to change.
